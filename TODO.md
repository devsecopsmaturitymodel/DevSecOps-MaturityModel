 - Default installation (no generated.yaml) does not work
 - Filter illogical / not working as expected


# ToDo
- App: Alert when generated.yaml is not found
- App: Filter radio buttons: Default, no selections: meaning all selected
- App: Make radio button, and use Ctrl-Click to multiple (hold click on mobile)

	<use id="cursor" href="#segment-Build-Level-2" fill="red" stroke-width="5" stroke="red"></use>
