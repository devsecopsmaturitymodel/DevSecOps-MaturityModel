        Gathering of defense metrics like TCP/UDP sources enables to assume the geographic location of the request.
        Assuming a Kubernetes cluster with an egress-traffic filter (e.g. IP/domain based), an alert might be send out in case of every violation. For ingress-traffic, alerting might not even be considered.
