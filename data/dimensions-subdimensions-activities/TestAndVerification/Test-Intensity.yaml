Test and Verification:
  Test-Intensity:
    Regular tests:
      risk:
      - After pushing source code to the version control system, any delay in receiving
        feedback on defects makes them harder for the developer to remediate.
      measure: On each push and/or at given intervals automatic security tests are
        performed.

    Creation and application of a testing concept:
      risk:
      - Scans might use a too small or too high test intensity.
      measure: A testing concept considering the amount of time per scan/intensity
        is created and applied. A dynamic analysis needs more time than a static analysis.
        The dynamic scan, depending on the test intensity might be performed on every
        commit, every night, every week or once in a month.

    Deactivating of unneeded tests:
      risk:
      - As tools cover a wide range of different vulnerability tests, they might not
        match the used components. Therefore, they need more time and resources as
        they need and the feedback loops takes too much time.
      measure: Unneeded tests are deactivated. For example in case the service is
        using a Mongo database and no mysql database, the dynamic scan doesn't need
        to test for sql injections.

    Default settings for intensity:
      risk:
      - Time pressure and ignorance might lead to false predictions for the test intensity.
      measure: The intensity of the used tools are not modified to safe time.

    High test intensity:
      risk:
      - A too small intensity or a too high confidence might lead to not visible vulnerabilities.
      measure: A deep scan with high test intensity and a low confidence threshold
        is performed.
