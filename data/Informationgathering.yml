  Alerting:
    risk: Incidents are discovered after they happend.
    measure: Thresholds for metrics are set. In case the thresholds are reached, alarms
      are send out. Which should get attention due to the critically.

  Coverage and control metrics:
    risk: The effectiveness of configuration, patch and vulnerablity management is
      unknown.
    measure: "Usage of Coverage- and control-metrics to show the effectivness of the
      security programm. Coverage is the degree in \n        which a specific security
      control for a specifc target group is applied with all resoucres.\n        The
      control degree shows the actual application of security standards and security-guidelines.
      Examples are gathering information on anti-virus, anti-rootkits, patch management,
      server configuration and vulnerability management."

  Defence metrics:
    risk: IDS/IPS systems like packet- or application-firewalls detect and prevent
      attacks. It is not known how many attacks has been detected and blocked.
    measure: Gathering of defence metrics like TCP/UDP sources enables to assume the
      geographic location of the requeist.

      helps to visualize incidents.

    risk: Attacks on an application are not recognized.

      force attacks, login/logout.

  Simple system metrics:
    risk: Without simple metrics analysis of incidents are hard. In case an application
      uses a lot of CPU from time to time, it is hard for a developer to find out
      the source with linux commands.
    measure: Gathering of system metrics helps to identify incidents and specially
      bottlenecks like in CPU usage, memory usage and hard disk usage.

  Targeted alerting:
    risk: People are bored (irodiert) of incident alarm messages, as they are not
      responsbile to react.
    measure: By the defintion of target groups for incidents people are only getting
      alarms for incidents they are in charge for.

Logging:
  Centralized application logging:
    risk: Local stored logs can be unauthorized manipulated by attackers with system
      access or might be corrupt after an incident. In addition, it is hard to perform
      an correlation of logs. This leads attacks, which can be performed silently.
    measure: A centralized logging system is used and applications logs (including
      application exceptions) are shipped to it.

  Logging of security events:
    risk: No track of security-relevant events makes it harder to analyse an incident.
    measure: Security-relevant events like login/logout or creation, change, deletion of users should be logged.

  Centralized system logging:
    risk: Local stored system logs can be unauthorized manipulated by attackers or
      might be corrupt after an incident. In addition, it is hard to perform a aggregation
      of logs.
    measure: By using centralized logging logs are protected against unauthorized
      modification.

  Correlation of security events:
    risk: Detection of security related events with hints on different systems/tools/metrics
      is not possible.
    measure: Events are correlated on one system. For example the correlation and
      visualisationof enhance login tries combined with successfull logins.

  Visualized logging:
    risk: System and application protocols are not visualized properly which leads
      to no or very limited logging assessment. Specally developers might have difficulty
      to read applications logs with unusually tools like the Linux tool 'cat'
    measure: Protocols are visualized in a simple to use real time monitoring system.
      The GUI gives the ability to search for specal attributes in the protocol.
