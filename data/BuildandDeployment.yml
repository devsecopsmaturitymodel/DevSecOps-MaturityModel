Build:
  Building and testing of artifacts in virtual environments:
    risk: While building and testing artifacts, third party systems, application frameworks
      and 3rd party libraries are used. These might be malicious as a result of vulnerable
      libraries or because they are altered during the delivery phase.
    measure: Each step during within the build and testing phase is performed in a separate virtual
      environments, which is destroyed afterward.

  Defined build process:
    risk: Performing builds without a defined process is error prone.
      For example, as a result of incorrect security related configuration.
    measure: A well defined build process lowers the possibility of errors during the build
      process.
    evidence: The build process is defined in <a href="REPLACE-ME">REPLACE-ME Pipeline</a> in the folder <i>vars</>. Projects are using a <i>Jenkinsfile</i> to use the defined process.

  Signing of artifacts:
    risk: Unauthorized manipulation of artifacts might be difficult to spot. For example, this may result in

Deployment:
  Backup before deployment:
    risk: If errors are experienced during the deployment process you want to deploy
      an old release. However, due to changes in the database this is often unfeasible.
    measure: Performing automated backups before deployment can help facilitate deployments whilst testing the backup restore processes.

  Blue/Green Deployment:
    risk: A new artifacts version can have unknown defects.
    measure: By having multiple production environments, a deployment can be performant
      on the first environment to spot possible defects before it is deployment in the production environment(s)

  Handover of confidential parameters:
    risk: Attackers who compromise a system can see confidential access information
      like database credentials. Parameters are often used to set credentials, for
      example by starting containers or applications. These parameters can often be
      seen by any one listing running processes on the target system.
    measure: By using encryption, it is harder to read credentials , e.g.
      from the file system. Also, the usage of a credential management system can help
      protect credentials.

  Same artifact for environments:
    risk: Building of an artifact for different environments means that an untested
      artifact might reach the production environment.

      that only tested artifacts are allowed to reach the production environment

  Usage of feature toggles:
    risk: By using environment dependent configuration, some parameters will not be
      tested correctly. i.e. <pre>if
      (host == 'production') {} else {}</pre>
    measure: Usage of environment independent configuration parameter, called feature
      toggles, helps to enhance the test coverage. Only what has been tested, goes to production.

  Inventory of running artifacts:

Patch Management:
  A patch policy is defined:

    measure: Fast patching of third party component is needed. The DevOps way is to have an automated pull request for new components. This includes <ul><li>Applications</li><li>Virutalized operating system components (e.g. container images)</li><li>Operating Systems</li><li>Infrastructure as Code/GitOps (e.g. argocd)</li></ul>

  Usage of a maximum lifetime for images:
    risk: Vulnerabilities in images of running containers stay for too long and might get exploited. Long running containers have potential memory leaks. A compromised container might get killed by restarting the container (e.g. in case the attacker has not reached the persistence layer).
    measure: The periodically builded images are deployed minimum every 30 days (better hourly/daily/weekly). Meaning an image is not in production for longer than 30 days.

    implementation:
      - Sample concept:<br/>(1) each container has a set lifetime and is killed / replaced with a new container multiple times a day where you have some form of a graceful replacement to ensure no (short) service outage will occur to the end users.<br/>(2) twice a day a rebuild of images is done. The rebuilds are put into a automated testing pipeline. If the testing has no blocking issues the new images will be released for deployment during the next "restart" of a container. What has to be done, is to ensure the new containers are deployed in some canary deployment manner, this will ensure that if (and only if) something buggy has been introduced which breaks functionality the canary deployment will make sure the "older version" is being used and not the buggy newer one.
  Reduction of the attack surface:
    risk: Components, dependencies, files or file access rights might have vulnerabilities, but the they are not needed.
    measure: Removal of not needed components, dependencies, files or file access rights. For container images the usage of distroless images is recommended.
