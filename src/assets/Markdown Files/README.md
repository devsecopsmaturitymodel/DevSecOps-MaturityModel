# About DSOMM

Modern software delivery is powered by agile teams, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and cloud-native platforms. While these practices have dramatically increased delivery speed and scalability, security often fails to mature at the same pace.

In many organizations, security controls that are mandatory in production environments are inconsistently applied, or entirely missing, in build pipelines, container registries, and integration workflows. This gap introduces unnecessary risk, including exposed registries, vulnerable container images, weak pipeline controls, and, in severe cases, the loss of proprietary source code.

The **OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model (DSOMM)** exists to close this gap.

## Why DSOMM Exists

DSOMM provides a structured, opinionated maturity model that helps organizations systematically integrate security into DevOps practices - without sacrificing delivery velocity. It enables teams to:

- Assess their current DevSecOps maturity
- Prioritize meaningful security improvements
- Incrementally strengthen security capabilities across the software lifecycle
- Align engineering, security, and leadership around a shared roadmap

Rather than treating security as a separate function or a final gate, DSOMM embeds security directly into how software is built, tested, and delivered.

## The DSOMM Application

The DSOMM Application operationalizes the maturity model by transforming abstract concepts into concrete, trackable activities. Teams can:

- Visualize maturity across dimensions and sub-dimensions
- Track implementation levels per activity
- Document progress using a GitOps-style workflow
- Attach evidence to activities for audit and executive reporting
- Map DSOMM activities to other standards and frameworks

This makes DSOMM equally valuable for engineers, security practitioners, auditors, and CISOs.

## Security as an Enabler

When implemented correctly, security strengthens DevOps rather than competing with it. Automated dependency scanning, container hardening, pipeline enforcement, and policy-driven controls are accelerators; not blockers.

DSOMM helps teams adopt these practices deliberately, measurably, and sustainably.

## Built for Continuous Change

Attackers evolve. Tooling advances. Threats adapt.

DSOMM provides a forward-looking framework that allows organizations to respond with clarity instead of reaction—grounded in shared language, shared priorities, and continuous improvement.

---

## Open and Community-Driven

DSOMM is an open, community-driven project under the umbrella of the OWASP Foundation. It is designed to be transparent, adaptable, and practical at any scale—from startups to multinational enterprises.

Contributions, feedback, and collaboration from the community are encouraged to ensure the model remains relevant and effective as DevSecOps practices evolve.
