# Description

In this combined User Day you will learn & have the chance to discuss with peers about two of OWASP’s major projects: DevSecOps Maturity Model (DSOMM) and Juice Shop!

In the morning, explore techniques for delivering effective secure coding workshops using Juice Shop. Then, in the afternoon, discover strategies for tailoring application security initiatives with the DevSecOps Maturity Model (DSOMM).

OWASP Juice Shop is - even after 10 years - still probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application. It encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other security flaws, packaged in a realistic and fully functional web shop. We will offer the following sessions about Juice Shop:
Beginner-friendly introduction session to the project, its features, and its use cases
Fun live demo of a very practical XSS exploit
Introduction of a way to run Juice Shop conveniently from an on-brand LEGO brick tower filled with Raspberry Pis
Fully hosted just-for-fun (and bragging rights) Capture the Flag event

Finally, you will have the chance to ask us any questions you may still have well into and during the lunch break!

The OWASP DSOMM User Day is an event centered on application security programs and related topics for startups and enterprises. It features a talk on building and optimizing AppSec programs, emphasizing custom organizational maturity models. The event includes a discussion on AppSec program experiences, as well as a presentation on using OWASP secureCodeBox for automating dynamic scans. Two workshops are offered: one on utilizing the DSOMM application to customize and distribute AppSec programs, and another on the Application and Vulnerability Maturity Model. Throughout the event, there's a focus on practical implementation, automation, and maturity models in the context of cloud and application security.

# Talk Descriptions

## Juice Shop Introduction
In the brief session, you will learn all the basics of the OWASP Juice Shop project: Why it exists, what it can do, where you can get it from, and how to get it running! This session will make sure that newcomers and experts alike can enjoy and follow in the subsequent Juice Shop sessions!

## Shake Logger XSS Demo
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) demonstrations in secure coding training often rely on simple alert boxes, which can understate the true risks of this vulnerability. This session will show you how to effectively illustrate the damage potential of XSS to both developers and non-technical audiences, providing a more realistic and compelling demonstration of its impact.

## Multi Juicer Introduction
Running CTFs and security trainings with OWASP Juice Shop is usually quite tricky, as Juice Shop isn't intended to be used by multiple users at the same time.
MultiJuicer is a Juice Shop sub-project designed to make running trainings and CTFs with Juice Shop as easy and effective as possible.
This session introduces the project and provides tips and tricks for setting it up in various cloud or on-prem environments.

## Just-for-fun CTF w/ MultiJuicer
In this session, we will use MultiJuicer to host a short CTF on a live MultiJuicer environment to demonstrate how it can be used for trainings and CTFs.
This will be a hands-on session, so be sure to bring your laptops!

## Application Security Program Experiences / Ask Anything
Brook and Timo will talk about their experiences with Application Security Programs.
Everyone is invited to join the conversation. Please bring your questions!

## DSOMM Live Assessment for the OWASP Juice Shop Application 
In this session, Timo will perform an assessment of the OWASP Juice Shop by interviewing other Juice Shop Core Members by filling out custom yaml files. Learn how to lead a DSOMM interview and at the same time fill out the DSOMM yaml files to document the assessment.

## Reach your Dynamic Depth with OWASP secureCodeBox
Implementing automated scanning for applications within an organization presents a complex task due to various factors. While configuring the scans themselves poses a challenge (DSOMM subdimension "Dynamic depth for applications"), interpreting and utilizing the resulting data in a meaningful way is often even more challenging (DSOMM subdimension "Consolidation").

This presentation aims to provide guidance on how to utilize the [OWASP secureCodeBox](https://www.securecodebox.io/) project as a tool to automate dynamic scans, leveraging tools such as ZAP, Nuclei, and SSLyze. Specifically, it will demonstrate how to either schedule regular scans or automatically create them via the [AutoDiscovery](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/auto-discovery/overview) feature of the secureCodeBox. The talk will also highlight the ability to utilize the secureCodeBox for automated creation of scans on Kubernetes deployments.

Furthermore, this presentation will showcase how the secureCodeBox can be used to automatically upload and organize scan results to [OWASP DefectDojo](https://defectdojo.com/), streamlining your security workflow.

## Workshop: Application and Vulnerability maturity Model (VMM) - DSOMM Map
Organizations face an ever-increasing risk of cyberattacks and data breaches. Vulnerabilities are getting discovered faster than ever, with a 34% YoY increase of vulnerability discovery. Vulnerabilities are often tackled as they come from security scanners, leading to burnout of security professionals, with 50% of security engineers considering changing their profession entirely. This workshop explores the vulnerability management process that applies to application, cloud, and infrastructure security.

To mitigate these risks, vulnerability management and triage have become essential components of an effective cybersecurity program. Vulnerability triage, in particular, plays a critical role in identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities to minimize the organization's attack surface across applications, cloud and infrastructure. However, the process of vulnerability triage is not a one-size-fits-all approach and requires a maturity model that reflects the organization's current state of readiness. In this workshop, you will explore the evolution of vulnerability management and triage process maturity and how organizations can enhance their capabilities to manage and mitigate cybersecurity risks effectively.

Why we created the vulnerability management process?
We created the vulnerability maturity model to provide a quick and easy assessment method to define where you are in the vulnerability assessment process from triage.
The VMM is mapped back to both SAMM, and DSOMM.
