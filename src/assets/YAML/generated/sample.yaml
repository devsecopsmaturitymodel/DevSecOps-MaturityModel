        While building and testing artifacts, third party systems, application frameworks
        and 3rd party libraries are used. These might be malicious as a result of
        vulnerable libraries or because they are altered during the delivery phase.
      measure: Each step during within the build and testing phase is performed in
        a separate virtual environments, which is destroyed afterward.
      meta:
        implementationGuide: Depending on your environment, usage of virtual machines
          or container technology is a good way. After the build, the filesystem should
          not be used again in other builds.

        changes, which are automatically used in an image used might break the functionality.
      measure: Pinning of artifacts ensure that changes are performed only when intended.
      comment: The usage of pinning requires a good processes for patching. Therefore,
        choose this activity wisly.

        # OWASP SAMM Description
        Threat modeling is a structured activity for identifying, evaluating, and managing system threats, architectural design flaws, and recommended security mitigations. It is typically done as part of the design phase or as part of a security assessment.

        Threat modeling is a team exercise, including product owners, architects, security champions, and security testers. At this maturity level, expose teams and stakeholders to threat modeling to increase security awareness and to create a shared vision on the security of the system.

        At maturity level 1, you perform threat modeling ad-hoc for high-risk applications and use simple threat checklists, such as STRIDE. Avoid lengthy workshops and overly detailed lists of low-relevant threats. Perform threat modeling iteratively to align to more iterative development paradigms. If you add new functionality to an existing application, look only into the newly added functions instead of trying to cover the entire scope. A good starting point is the existing diagrams that you annotate during discussion workshops. Always make sure to persist the outcome of a threat modeling discussion for later use.

        Your most important tool to start threat modeling is a whiteboard, smartboard, or a piece of paper. Aim for security awareness, a simple process, and actionable outcomes that you agree upon with your team.      Once requirements are gathered and analysis is performed, implementation specifics need to be defined. The outcome of this stage is usually a diagram outlining data flows and a general system architecture. This presents an opportunity for both threat modeling and attaching security considerations to every ticket and epic that is the outcome of this stage.

        Source: https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/threat-assessment/stream-b/
        # OWASP Project Integration Description
        There is some great advice on threat modeling out there *e.g.* [this](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/07/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-mostly-and-love-my-threat-model/) article or [this](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl/threatmodeling) one.

        A bite sized primer by Adam Shostack himself can be found [here](https://adam.shostack.org/blog/2018/03/threat-modeling-panel-at-appsec-cali-2018/).

        OWASP includes a short [article](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Threat_Modeling) on Threat Modeling along with a relevant [Cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html). Moreover, if you're following OWASP SAMM, it has a short section on [Threat Assessment](https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/threat-assessment/).

        There's a few projects that can help with creating Threat Models at this stage, [PyTM](https://github.com/izar/pytm) is one, [ThreatSpec](https://github.com/threatspec/threatspec) is another.

        > Note: _A threat model can be as simple as a data flow diagram with attack vectors on every flow and asset and equivalent remediations. An example can be found below._

        ![Threat Model](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-integration-standards/raw/master/writeups/owasp_in_sdlc/images/threat_model.png "Threat Model")

        Last, if the organizations maps Features to Epics, the Security Knowledge Framework (SKF) can be used to facilitate this process by leveraging it's questionnaire function.

        ![SKF](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-integration-standards/raw/master/writeups/owasp_in_sdlc/images/skf_qs.png "SKF")

        This practice has the side effect that it trains non-security specialists to think like attackers.

        The outcomes of this stage should help lay the foundation of secure design and considerations.

        **Example Low Maturity Scenario:**

        Following vague feature requirements the design includes caching data to a local unencrypted database with a hardcoded password.

        Remote data store access secrets are hardcoded in the configuration files. All communication between backend systems is plaintext.

        Frontend serves data over GraphQL as a thin layer between caching system and end user.

        GraphQL queries are dynamically translated to SQL, Elasticsearch and NoSQL queries. Access to data is protected with basic auth set to _1234:1234_ for development purposes.

      description: "Implement a program where each software development team has a
        member considered a \u201CSecurity Champion\u201D who is the liaison between
        Information Security and developers. Depending on the size and structure of
        the team the \u201CSecurity Champion\u201D may be a software developer, tester,
        or a product manager. The \u201CSecurity Champion\u201D has a set number of
        hours per week for Information Security related activities. They participate
        in periodic briefings to increase awareness and expertise in different security
        disciplines. \u201CSecurity Champions\u201D have additional training to help
        develop these roles as Software Security subject-matter experts. You may need
        to customize the way you create and support \u201CSecurity Champions\u201D
        for cultural reasons.\n\nThe goals of the position are to increase effectiveness
        and efficiency of application security and compliance and to strengthen the
        relationship between various teams and Information Security. To achieve these
        objectives, \u201CSecurity Champions\u201D assist with researching, verifying,
        and prioritizing security and compliance related software defects. They are
        involved in all Risk Assessments, Threat Assessments, and Architectural Reviews
        to help identify opportunities to remediate security defects by making the
        architecture of the application more resilient and reducing the attack threat

        Conduct security awareness training for all roles currently involved in the management, development, testing, or auditing of the software. The goal is to increase the awareness of application security threats and risks, security best practices, and secure software design principles. Develop training internally or procure it externally. Ideally, deliver training in person so participants can have discussions as a team, but Computer-Based Training (CBT) is also an option.

        Course content should include a range of topics relevant to application security and privacy, while remaining accessible to a non-technical audience. Suitable concepts are secure design principles including Least Privilege, Defense-in-Depth, Fail Secure (Safe), Complete Mediation, Session Management, Open Design, and Psychological Acceptability. Additionally, the training should include references to any organization-wide standards, policies, and procedures defined to improve application security. The OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities should be covered at a high level.

        Training is mandatory for all employees and contractors involved with software development and includes an auditable sign-off to demonstrate compliance. Consider incorporating innovative ways of delivery (such as gamification) to maximize its effectiveness and combat desensitization.

    Simple mob hacking:
      risk: Understanding security is hard.
      measure: |
        Participate with your whole team in a simple mob hacking session organized by the Security Champion Guild.
        In the session the guild presents a vulnerable application and together you look at possible exploits.
        Just like in mob programming there is one driver and several navigators.
      description: |
        ### Guidelines for your simple mob hacking session
        - All exploits happen via the user interface.
        - No need for security/hacking tools.
        - No need for deep technical or security knowledge.
        - Use an insecure training app, e.g., [DVWA](https://dvwa.co.uk/) or [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/).
        - Encourage active participation, e.g., use small groups.
        - Allow enough time for everyone to run at least one exploit.

        ### Benefits
        - The team gets an idea of how exploits can look like and how easy applications can be attacked.
        - The team understands functional correct working software can be highly insecure and easy to exploit.

        To tackle the security of code developed in-house, OWASP offers an extensive collection of [Cheatsheets](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/) demonstrating how to implement features securely. Moreover, the Security Knowledge Framework[1] offers an extensive library of code patterns spanning several programming languages. These patterns can be used to not only jumpstart the development process, but also do so securely.

        [...]

        ### Planning aka Requirements Gathering & Analysis
        The Requirements gathering process tries to answer the question: _"What is the system going to do?"_ At this stage, the [SAMM project](https://owaspsamm.org/model/) offers 3 distinct maturity levels covering both [in-house](https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/stream-a/) software development and [third party](https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/stream-b/) supplier security.

        ![SAMM Requirements](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-integration-standards/raw/master/writeups/owasp_in_sdlc/images/OWASP-in0.png)

        Organizations can use these to add solid security considerations at the start of the Software Development or Procurement process.

        These general security considerations can be audited by using a subsection of the ASVS controls in section V1 as a questionnaire. This process attempts to ensure that every feature has concrete security considerations.

        In case of internal development and if the organization maps Features to Epics, the [Security Knowledge Framework](https://securityknowledgeframework.org/) can be used to facilitate this process by leveraging its questionnaire function, shown below.

    Logging of security events:
      description: |
        Implement logging of security relevant events. The following events tend to be security relevant:
          - successful/failed login/logout
          - creation, change, and deletion of users
          - errors during input validation and output creation
          - exceptions and errors with security in their name
          - transactions of value (e.g., financial transactions, costly operations)
          - :unicorn: (special things of your application)
      risk-md: |
        - No track of security-relevant events makes it harder to analyze an incident.
        - Security incident analysis takes significantly less time with proper security events, such that an attack can be stopped before the attacker reaches his goal.
      measure: Security-relevant events like login/logout or creation, change, deletion
        of users should be logged.
      assessment: |
        - Show which events are logged.
        - Show a test for one event logging.

  Dynamic depth for infrastructure:
    Load tests:
      risk:
      - As it is unknown how many requests the systems and applications can serve,
        due to an unexpected load the availability is disturbed.
      measure: Load test against the production system or a production near system
        is performed.

    Test for exposed services:
      risk:
      - Standard network segmentation and firewalling has not been performed, leading
        to world open cluster management ports.
      measure: With the help of tools the network configuration of unintentional exposed
        cluster(s) are tested. To identify clusters, all subdomains might need to
        be identified with a tool like OWASP Amass to perform portscans based o the
        result.

    Test for unused Resources:
      risk:
      - Unused resources, specially secrets, might be still valid, but are exposing
        information. As an attacker, I compromise a system, gather credentials and
        try to use them.
      measure: Test for unused resources helps to identify unused resources.

  Test-Intensity:
    Creation and application of a testing concept:
      risk:
      - Scans might use a too small or too high test intensity.
      measure: A testing concept considering the amount of time per scan/intensity
        is created and applied. A dynamic analysis needs more time than a static analysis.
        The dynamic scan, depending on the test intensity might be performed on every
        commit, every night, every week or once in a month.

    Deactivating of unneeded tests:
      risk:
      - As tools cover a wide range of different vulnerability tests, they might not
        match the used components. Therefore, they need more time and resources as
        they need and the feedback loops takes too much time.
      measure: Unneeded tests are deactivated. For example in case the service is
        using a Mongo database and no mysql database, the dynamic scan doesn't need
        to test for sql injections.
