# Generated YAML Files

This folder contains the `generated.yaml` file, which is dynamically created during the build process.  
It stores configuration settings and other automatically generated data used by the DevSecOps Maturity Model (DSOMM).  

## **What is `generated.yaml`?**

- It is a machine-generated file that is **not meant to be manually edited**.
- It helps in **storing configuration settings**, which are loaded at runtime.
- Used by the application to dynamically configure settings.
- This file is generated via the [DevSecOps-MaturityModel-data](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/DevSecOps-MaturityModel-data) repository.
