        While building and testing artifacts, third party systems, application frameworks

        While building and testing artifacts, third party systems, application frameworks
        and 3rd party libraries are used. These might be malicious as a result of
        vulnerable libraries or because they are altered during the delivery phase.
      measure: Each step during within the build and testing phase is performed in
        a separate virtual environments, which is destroyed afterward.
      meta:
        implementationGuide: Depending on your environment, usage of virtual machines
          or container technology is a good way. After the build, the filesystem should
          not be used again in other builds.

    Defined build process:
      risk: Performing builds without a defined process is error prone; for example,
        as a result of incorrect security related configuration.
      measure: A well defined build process lowers the possibility of errors during
        the build process.

        Sample evidence as an attribute in the yaml: The build process is defined in <a href="REPLACE-ME">REPLACE-ME Pipeline</a>
        in the folder <i>vars</>. Projects are using a <i>Jenkinsfile</i> to use the
        defined process.

        - Show your build pipeline and an exemplary job (build + test).
        - Show that every team member has access.
        - Show that failed jobs are fixed.

    Pinning of artifacts:
      risk: Unauthorized manipulation of artifacts might be difficult to spot. For
        example, this may result in using images with malicious code. Also, intendend
        major changes, which are automatically used in an image used might break the
        functionality.
      measure: Pinning of artifacts ensure that changes are performed only when intended.
      comment: The usage of pinning requires a good processes for patching. Therefore,
        choose this activity wisly.

      - Container technology automatically creates a hash for images, which can be
        used.
      - Immutable images are an other way, e.g. by using a registry, which doesn't
        allow overriding of images.

    SBOM of components:
