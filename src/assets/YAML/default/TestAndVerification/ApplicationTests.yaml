Test and Verification:
  Application tests:
    High coverage of security related module and integration tests:
      risk:
      - Vulnerabilities are rising due to code changes in a complex microservice environment
        in not important components.
      measure: Implementation of security related tests via unit tests and integration
        tests. Including the test of libraries, in case the are not tested already.

    Security integration tests for important components:
      risk:

        The integration of module tests takes place during development instead, it highlights vulnerabilities in sub-routines, functions, modules, libraries etc. checked.
        A sample implementation of unit tests are explained in the video [Shift-Left-Security with the Security Test Pyramid - Andreas Falk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzFZy3f7d8E) starting with minute 9.
      implementation:
      - $ref: data/dimensions-subdimensions-activities/implementations.yaml#/implementations/junit
      - $ref: data/dimensions-subdimensions-activities/implementations.yaml#/implementations/karma

    Smoke Test:
      risk:
      - During a deployment an error might happen which leads to non-availability
        of the system, a part of the system or a feature.
      measure: Integration tests are performed against the production environment
        after each deployment.
