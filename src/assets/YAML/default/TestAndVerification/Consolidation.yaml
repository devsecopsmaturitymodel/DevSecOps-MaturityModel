    Integration of vulnerability issues into the development process:
      risk: To read console output of the build server to search for vulnerabilities
        might be difficult. Also, to check a vulnerability management system might
        not be a daily task for a developer.
      measure: Vulnerabilities are tracked in the teams issue system (e.g. jira).

    Reproducible defect tickets:
      risk: Vulnerability descriptions are hard to understand by staff from operations
        and development.
      measure: Vulnerabilities include the test procedure to give the staff from operations
        and development the ability to reproduce vulnerabilities. This enhances the
        understanding of vulnerabilities and therefore the fix have a higher quality.

    Simple false positive treatment:
      risk: As false positive occur during each test, all vulnerabilities might be
        ignored.
      measure: False positives are suppressed so they will not show up on the next
        tests again. Most security tools have the possibility to suppress false positives.
        A Vulnerability Management System might be used.
