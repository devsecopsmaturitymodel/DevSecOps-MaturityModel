    Usage of internal encryption at tansit:
      risk: Evil actors within the organization of traffic in transit might be able
        to perform a man in the middle attack and sniff confidential information (e.g.
        authentication factors like passwords)
      measure: By using encryption internally, e.g. inside of a cluster, it is impossible
        or at least harder to sniff credentials.

    Usage of security by default for components:
      risk: Components (images, libraries, applications) are not hardened.
      measure: Hardening of components is important, specially for image on which
        other teams base on. Hardening should be performed on the operation system
        and on the services inside (e.g. Nginx or a Java-Application).
