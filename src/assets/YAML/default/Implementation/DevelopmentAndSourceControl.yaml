    Pre-Commit checks and validations:
      risk: Using an insecure application might lead to a compromised application.
        This might lead to total data theft or data modification.

        Implement pre-commit checks to prevent secrets & other security issues being commit to source code.

    API design validation:

      measure: |
        Design contract-first APIs using an interface description language such as OpenAPI, AsyncAPI or SOAP
        and validate the specification using specific tools.
        Checks should be integrated in IDEs and CI/CD pipelines.

    Source Control Protection:
      risk: Intentional or accidental alterations in critical branches like master.
      measure: >-
        Define source code management system policies (e.g. branch protection rules,
        mandatory code reviews, ...)
        to ensure that changes to critical branches are only possible under defined conditions.
        These policies can be implemented at repository level or organization level,
        depending on the source code management system.
