Culture and Organization:
  Process:
    Approval by reviewing any new version:
      risk: An individual might forget to implement security measures to protect source
        code or infrastructure components.
      measure: On each new version (e.g. Pull Request) of source code or infrastructure
        components a security peer review of the changes is performed (two eyes principle)
        and approval given by the reviewer.

    Definition of a change management process:
      risk: The impact of a change is not controlled because these are not recorded
        or documented.
      measure: Each change of a system is automatically recorded and adequately logged.

    Definition of simple BCDR practices for critical components:
      risk: In case of an emergency, like a power outage, DR actions to perform are
        not clear. This leads to reaction and remediation delays.
      measure: By understanding and documenting a business continuity and disaster
        recovery (BCDR) plan, the overall availability of systems and applications
        is increased. Success factors like responsibilities, Service Level Agreements,
        Recovery Point Objectives, Recovery Time Objectives or Failover must be fully
        documented and understood.

    Prevention of unauthorized installation:
      risk: Unapproved components are used.
      measure: Components must be whitelisted. Regular scans on the docker infrastructure
        (e.g. cluster) need to be performed, to verify that only standardized base
        images are used.
