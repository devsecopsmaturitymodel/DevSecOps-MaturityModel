    Ad-Hoc Security trainings for software developers:
      risk: Understanding security is hard and personnel needs to be trained on it.
        Otherwise, flaws like an SQL Injection might be introduced into the software
        which might get exploited.
      measure: Provide security awareness training for all personnel involved in software
        development Ad-Hoc.

    Conduction of build-it, break-it, fix-it contests:
      risk: Understanding security is hard, even for security champions and the conduction
        of security training often focuses on breaking a component instead of building
        a component secure.

        Conduct security awareness training for all roles currently involved in the management, development, testing, or auditing of the software. The goal is to increase the awareness of application security threats and risks, security best practices, and secure software design principles. Develop training internally or procure it externally. Ideally, deliver training in person so participants can have discussions as a team, but Computer-Based Training (CBT) is also an option.

        Course content should include a range of topics relevant to application security and privacy, while remaining accessible to a non-technical audience. Suitable concepts are secure design principles including Least Privilege, Defense-in-Depth, Fail Secure (Safe), Complete Mediation, Session Management, Open Design, and Psychological Acceptability. Additionally, the training should include references to any organization-wide standards, policies, and procedures defined to improve application security. The OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities should be covered at a high level.

        Training is mandatory for all employees and contractors involved with software development and includes an auditable sign-off to demonstrate compliance. Consider incorporating innovative ways of delivery (such as gamification) to maximize its effectiveness and combat desensitization.

    Simple mob hacking:
      risk: Understanding security is hard.
      measure: |
        Participate with your whole team in a simple mob hacking session organized by the Security Champion Guild.
        In the session the guild presents a vulnerable application and together you look at possible exploits.
        Just like in mob programming there is one driver and several navigators.
      description: |
        ### Guidelines for your simple mob hacking session
        - All exploits happen via the user interface.
        - No need for security/hacking tools.
        - No need for deep technical or security knowledge.
        - Use an insecure training app, e.g., [DVWA](https://dvwa.co.uk/) or [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/).
        - Encourage active participation, e.g., use small groups.
        - Allow enough time for everyone to run at least one exploit.

        ### Benefits
        - The team gets an idea of how exploits can look like and how easy applications can be attacked.
        - The team understands functional correct working software can be highly insecure and easy to exploit.
