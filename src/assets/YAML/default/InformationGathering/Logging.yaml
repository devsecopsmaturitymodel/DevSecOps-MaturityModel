    Centralized application logging:
      uuid: fe875e17-ae4a-45f8-a359-244aa4fcbc04
      risk:
        Local stored logs can be unauthorized manipulated by attackers with system
        access or might be corrupt after an incident. In addition, it is hard to perform
        an correlation of logs. This leads attacks, which can be performed silently.
      measure:
        A centralized logging system is used and applications logs (including
        application exceptions) are shipped to it.

    Centralized system logging:

      risk:
        Local stored system logs can be unauthorized manipulated by attackers
        or might be corrupt after an incident. In addition, it is hard to perform
        a aggregation of logs.
      measure:
        By using centralized logging logs are protected against unauthorized
        modification.

    Correlation of security events:

    Logging of security events:

      description: |
        Implement logging of security relevant events. The following events tend to be security relevant:
          - successful/failed login/logout
          - creation, change, and deletion of users
          - errors during input validation and output creation
          - exceptions and errors with security in their name
          - transactions of value (e.g., financial transactions, costly operations)
          - :unicorn: (special things of your application)
      measure:
        Security-relevant events like login/logout or creation, change, deletion
        of users should be logged.
      assessment: |
        - Show which events are logged.
        - Show a test for one event logging.

    Visualized logging:

      risk:
        System and application protocols are not visualized properly which leads
        to no or very limited logging assessment. Specially developers might have
        difficulty to read applications logs with unusually tools like the Linux tool
        'cat'
      measure:
        Protocols are visualized in a simple to use real time monitoring system.
        The GUI gives the ability to search for special attributes in the protocol.
