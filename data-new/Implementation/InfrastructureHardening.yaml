Infrastructure Hardening:
  The cluster is hardened:
    risk:
    - Using default configurations for a cluster environment leads to potential risks.
    measure: Harden cluster environments according to best practices. Level 1 and
      partially level 2 from hardening practices like 'CIS Kubernetes Bench for Security'
      should considered.

  Applications are running in virtualized environments:
    risk:
    - Through a vulnerability in one service on a server, the attacker gains access
      to other services running on the same server.
    measure: Applications are running in a dedicated and isolated virtualized environments.

  Isolated networks for virtual environments:
    risk:
    - Virtual environments in default settings are able to access other virtual environments
      on the network stack. By using virtual machines, it is often possible to connect
      to other virtual machines. By using docker, one bridge is used by default so
      that all containers on one host can communicate with each other.
    measure: The communication between virtual environments is controlled and regulated.

  Filter outgoing traffic:

  Infrastructure as Code:
    risk:
    - No tracking of changes in systems might lead to errors in the configuration.
      In additions, it might lead to unauthorized changes. An examples is jenkins.
    measure: Systems are setup by code. A full environment can be provisioned. In
      addition, software like Jenkins 2 can be setup and configured in in code too.
      The code should be stored in a version control system.

  Production near environments are used by developers:
    risk:
    - In case an errors occurs in production, the developer need to be able to create
      a production near environment on a local development environment.
    measure: Usage of infrastructure as code helps to create a production near environment.
      The developer needs to be trained in order to setup a local development environment.
      In addition, it should be possible to create production like test data. Often
      personal identifiable information is anonymized in order to comply with data
      protection laws.

      to authorized users.

  Usage of a chaos monkey:

      of a crash it might happen that a planned redundant system is unavailable. In
      addition, it is hard to replay manual changes.

      will perform manual changes to a system.

    risk:

      the services inside (e.g. Nginx or a Java-Application).
