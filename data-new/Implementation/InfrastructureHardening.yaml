Infrastructure Hardening:
  The cluster is hardened:
    risk: Using default configurations for a cluster environment leads to potential
      risks.
    measure: Harden cluster environments according to best practices. Level 1 and
      partiually level 2 from hardening practices like 'CIS Kubernetes Bench for Security'
      should considered.

  Applications are running in virtualized environments:
    risk: Through a vulnerability in one service on a server, the attacker gains access
      to other services running on the same server.
    measure: Applications are running in a dedicated and isolated virtualized environments.

  Checking the sources of used libraries:
    risk: Application and system libraries can have implementation flaws or deployment
      flaws.
    measure: Each libraries source is checked to have a trusted source.

  Isolated networks for virtual environments:
    risk: Virtual environments in default settings are able to access other virtual
      environments on the network stack. By using virtual machines, it is often possible
      to connect to other virtual machines. By using docker, one bridge is used by
      default so that all containers on one host can communicate with each other.
    measure: The communication between virtual environments is controlled and regulated.

  Filter outgoing traffic:
    risk: A compromised infrastructure component might try to send out stolen data.
    measure: Having a whitelist and explizitly allowing egress traffic provides the
      ability to stop unauthorized data leackage.

  Infrastructure as Code:
    risk: No tracking of changes in systems might lead to errors in the configuration.
      In additions, it might lead to unauthorized changes. An examples is jenkins.
    measure: Systems are setup by code. A full environment can be provisioned. In
      addition, software like Jenkins 2 can be setup and configured in in code too.
      The code should be stored in a version control system.

  Microservice-Architecture:
    risk: Monolithic applications are hard to test.

      more easy to test.

  Production near environments are used by developers:
    risk: In case an errors occurs in production, the developer need to be able to
      create a production near environment on a local development environment.
    measure: Usage of infrastructure as code helps to create a production near environment.
      The developer needs to be trained in order to setup a local development environment.
      In addition, it should be possible to create production like test data. Often
      personal identifiable information is anonymized in order to comply with data
      protection laws.

  Role based authentication and authorization:
    risk: Everyone is able to get unauthorized access to information on systems or
      to modify information unauthorized on systems.
    measure: The usage of a (role based) access control helps to restrict system access
      to authorized users.

  Usage of a chaos monkey:
    risk: Due to manuel changes on a system, they are not replaceable anymore. In
      case of a crash it might happen that a planned redundant system is unavailable.
      In addition, it is hard to replay manual changes.
    measure: A randomized periodically shutdown of systems makes sure, that nobody
      will perform manual changes to a system.

  Usage of security by default for components:
    risk: Components (images, libraries, applications) are not hardened.
    measure: Hardening of components is important, specially for image on which other
      teams base on. Hardening should be performed on the operation system and on
      the services inside (e.g. Nginx or a Java-Application).
