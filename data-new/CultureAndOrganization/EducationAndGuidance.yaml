Education and Guidance:
  Ad-Hoc Security trainings for software developers:
    risk: Understanding security is hard and personnel needs to be trained on it.
      Otherwise, flaws like an SQL Injection might be introduced into the software
      which might get exploited.
    measure: Provide security awareness training for all personnel involved in software
      development Ad-Hoc.

  Security consulting on request:
    risk: Not asking a security expert when questions regarding security appear might
      lead to flaws.
    measure: Security consulting to teams is given on request. The security consultants
      can be internal or external.

  Each team has a security champion:
    risk: No one feels directly responsible for security and the security champion
      does not have enough time to allocate to each team.
    measure: Each team defines an individual to be responsible for security. These
      individuals are often referred to as 'security champions'

  Security-Lessoned-Learned:
    risk: After an incident, a similar incident might reoccur.
    measure: Running a 'lessons learned' session after an incident helps drive continuous
      improvement. Regular meetings with security champions are a good place to share
      and discuss lessons learned.

  Conduction of collaborative security checks with developers and system administrators:
    risk: Security checks by external companies do not increase the understanding
      of an application/system for internal employees.
    measure: Periodically security reviews of source code (SCA), in which security
      SME, developers and operations are involved, are effective at increasing the
      robustness of software and the security knowledge of the teams involved.

      security awareness and knowledge.

  Conduction of build-it, break-it, fix-it contests:
    risk: Understanding security is hard, even for security champions and the conduction
      of security training often focuses on breaking a component instead of building
      a component secure.
    measure: The build-it, break-it, fix-it contest allows to train people with security
      related roles like security champions the build, break and fix part of a secure
      application. This increases the learning of building secure components.

  Conduction of war games:
    risk: Understanding incident response plans during an incident is hard and ineffective.
    measure: War Games like activities help train for incidents. Security SMEs create
      attack scenarios in a testing environment enabling the trainees to learn how
      to react in case of an incident.

  Reward of good communication:
    risk: Employees are not getting excited about security.
    measure: Good communication and transparency encourages cross-organisational support.
      Gamification of security is also known to help, examples include T-Shirts, mugs,
      cups, giftcards and 'High-Fives'.

  Aligning security in teams:
    risk: The concept of Security Champions might suggest that only he/she is responsible
      for security. However, everyone in the project team should be responsible for
      security.
    measure: By aligning security SME with project teams, a higher security standard
      can be achieved.
