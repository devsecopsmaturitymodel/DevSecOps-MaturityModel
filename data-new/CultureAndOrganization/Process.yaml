Process:
  Definition of simple BCDR practices for critical components:
    risk: In case of an emergency, like a power outage, DR actions to perform are
      not clear. This leads to reaction and remediation delays.
    measure: By understanding and documenting a business continuity and disaster recovery
      (BCDR) plan, the overall availability of systems and applications is increased.
      Success factors like responsibilities, Service Level Agreements, Recovery Point
      Objectives, Recovery Time Objectives or Failover must be fully documented and
      understood.

  Definition of a change management process:
    risk: The impact of a change is not controlled because these are not recorded
      or documented.
    measure: Each change of a system is automatically recorded and adequately logged.

  Approval by reviewing any new version:
    risk: An individual might forget to implement security measures to protect source
      code or infrastructure components.
    measure: On each new version (e.g. Pull Request) of source code or infrastructure
      components a security peer review of the changes is performed (two eyes principle)
      and approval given by the reviewer.

  Prevention of unauthorized installation:
    risk: Unapproved components are used.
    measure: Components must be whitelisted. Regular scans on the docker infrastructure
      (e.g. cluster) need to be performed, to verify that only standardized base images
      are used.

    implementation: 'Example: All docker images used by teams need to be based on
      standard images.'
    comment: By preventing teams from trying out new components, innovation might
      be hampered
