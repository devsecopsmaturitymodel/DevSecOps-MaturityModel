      It is not known how many attacks has been detected and blocked.

      Gathering of defense metrics like TCP/UDP sources enables to assume the geographic location of the request.
      Assuming a Kubernetes cluster with an egress-traffic filter (e.g. IP/domain based), an alert might be send out in case of every violation. For ingress-traffic, alerting might not even be considered.

    - Without simple metrics analysis of incidents are hard. In case an application
      uses a lot of CPU from time to time, it is hard for a developer to find out

      bottlenecks like in CPU usage, memory usage and hard disk usage.
