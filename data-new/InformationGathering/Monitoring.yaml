  Advanced availablity and stability metrics:
    risk: Trends and advanced attacks are not detected.
    measure: Advanced metrics are gathered in relation to availability and stability.

  Alerting:
    risk: Incidents are discovered after they happend.

      Thresholds for metrics are set. In case the thresholds are reached, alarms are send out. Which should get attention due to the critically.

  Coverage and control metrics:
    risk: The effectiveness of configuration, patch and vulnerability management is
      unknown.
    measure: "Usage of Coverage- and control-metrics to show the effectiveness of\
      \ the security program. Coverage is the degree in \n        which a specific\
      \ security control for a specific target group is applied with all resources.\n\
      \        The control degree shows the actual application of security standards\
      \ and security-guidelines. Examples are gathering information on anti-virus,\
      \ anti-rootkits, patch management, server configuration and vulnerability management."

  Defence metrics:
    risk: IDS/IPS systems like packet- or application-firewalls detect and prevent
      attacks. It is not known how many attacks has been detected and blocked.
    measure: |
      Gathering of defence metrics like TCP/UDP sources enables to assume the geographic location of the request.
      Assuming a Kubernetes cluster with an egress-traffic filter (e.g. IP/domain based), an alert might be send out in case of every violation. For ingress-traffic, alerting might not even be considered.

    risk: Security related information is discovered too late during an incident.

      helps to visualize incidents.

  Simple system metrics:
    risk: Without simple metrics analysis of incidents are hard. In case an application
      uses a lot of CPU from time to time, it is hard for a developer to find out
      the source with linux commands.
    measure: Gathering of system metrics helps to identify incidents and specially
      bottlenecks like in CPU usage, memory usage and hard disk usage.

  Targeted alerting:
    risk: People are bored (ignorant) of incident alarm messages, as they are not
      responsible to react.
    measure: By the definition of target groups for incidents people are only getting
      alarms for incidents they are in charge for.
