  Test of infrastructure components for known vulnerabilities:
    risk: Infrastructure components might have vulnerabilities.
    measure: Test for known vulnerabilities in infrastructure components. Often, the
      only way to respond to known vulnerabilities in operating system packages is
      to accept the risk and wait for a patch. As the patch needs to be applied fast
      when it is available, this activity depends on 'Usage of a maximum life for
      images'.
