Dynamic depth for applications:
  Coverage analysis:
    risk: Parts of the service are not still covered.
    measure: Check that there are no missing paths in the application with coverage-tools.

    - part of periodic review, PDCA
  Coverage of client side dynamic components:
    risk: Parts of the service are not covered during the scan, because JavaScript
      is not getting executed. Therefore, the co
    measure: Usage of a spider which executes dynamic content like JavaScript, e.g.
      via Selenium.

  Coverage of hidden endpoints:

      scan.

  Coverage of more input vectors:
    risk: Parts of the service are not covered. For example specially formatted or
      coded parameters are not getting detected as parameter (e.g. parameters in REST-like
      URLs, parameters in JSON-Format or base64-coded parameters).
    measure: Special parameter and special encodings are defined, so that they get
      fuzzed by the used vulnerability scanners.

  Coverage of sequential operations:
    risk: Sequential operations like workflows (e.g. login -> put products in the
      basket
    measure: Sequential operations are defined and checked by the vulnerability scanner
      in the defined order.

  Simple Scan:
    risk: Deficient security tests are performed. Simple vulnerabilities are not detected
      and missing security configurations (e.g. headers) are not set. Fast feedback
      is not given.
    measure: A simple scan is performed to get a security baseline. In case the test
      is done in under 10 minutes, it should be part of the build and deployment process.

  Usage of different roles:

  Usage of multiple scanners:
    risk: Each vulnerability scanner has different opportunities. By using just one
      scanner, some vulnerabilities might not be found.
