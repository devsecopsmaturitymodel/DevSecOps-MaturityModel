  Coverage analysis:
    risk:

  Coverage of client side dynamic components:
    risk:
    - Parts of the service are not covered during the scan, because JavaScript is

  Coverage of more input vectors:

      parameters are not getting detected as parameter (e.g. parameters in REST-like
      URLs, parameters in JSON-Format or base64-coded parameters).
    measure: Special parameter and special encodings are defined, so that they get
      fuzzed by the used vulnerability scanners.

  Coverage of sequential operations:

  Simple Scan:
    risk:
    - Deficient security tests are performed. Simple vulnerabilities are not detected
      and missing security configurations (e.g. headers) are not set. Fast feedback
      is not given.
    measure: A simple scan is performed to get a security baseline. In case the test
      is done in under 10 minutes, it should be part of the build and deployment process.
