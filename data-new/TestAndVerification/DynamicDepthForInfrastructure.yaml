Dynamic depth for infrastructure:
  Load tests:
    risk:
    - As it is unknown how many requests the systems and applications can serve, due
      to an unexpected load the availability is disturbed.
    measure: Load test against the production system or a production near system is
      performed.

  Test of the configuration of cloud environments:
    risk:
    - Standard hardening practices for cloud environments are not performed leading
      to vulnerabilities.
    measure: With the help of tools the configuration of virtual environments are
      tested.

  Weak password test:
    risk:
    - Weak passwords in components like applications or systems, specially for privileged
      accounts, lead to take over of that account.
    measure: Automatic brute force attacks are performed. Specially the usage of standard
      accounts like 'admin' and employee user-ids is recommended.

  Test network segmentation:
    risk:
    - Wrong or no network segmentation of pods makes it easier for an attacker to
      access a database and extract or modify data.
    measure: Cluster internal test needs to be performed. Integration of fine granulated
      network segmentation (also between pods in the same namespace).

  Test for exposed services:
    risk:
    - Standard network segmentation and firewalling has not been performed, leading
      to world open cluster management ports.
    measure: With the help of tools the network configuration of unintentional exposed
      cluster(s) are tested. To identify clusters, all subdomains might need to be
      identified with a tool like OWASP Amass to perform portscans based o the result.
